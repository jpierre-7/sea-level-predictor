### Summary
This is my submission for the freecodecamp Sea Level Predictor project under the ***"Data Analysis with Python"*** certification program. A link to the project page can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/sea-level-predictor).

### Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of global average sea level changes since 1880. The data and analysis will then be used to predict sea level change through year 2050.
